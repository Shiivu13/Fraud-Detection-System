# Fraud-Detection-System
A production-style fraud detection system built step by step with a strong focus on real-world constraints such as imbalanced data, explainability, decision thresholds, and deployment reliability.
This project emphasizes engineering decisions and system ownership, not just model accuracy.

 Project Goals
The primary goal of this project was to design and implement a complete ML system, not just train a model.
Key objectives:
Handle extremely imbalanced fraud data
Avoid misleading metrics (accuracy)
Use business-driven decision thresholds
Make predictions explainable and auditable
Deploy the model as a reliable API
Demonstrate the system via a simple frontend
Ensure reproducibility using Docker

 Key Engineering Decisions
1️⃣ Metrics over Accuracy
Fraud data is highly imbalanced, so accuracy was avoided.
Instead:
Precision–Recall Curve
PR-AUC
Threshold-based evaluation
2️⃣ Business-Driven Threshold
Instead of using a default probability threshold (0.5), a custom threshold was selected based on recall-precision trade-offs relevant to fraud detection.
3️⃣ Explainability First
Each prediction is accompanied by:
SHAP feature attributions
A human-readable explanation summarizing why the transaction was flagged
4️⃣ Robust API Design
The API:
Accepts partial feature inputs
Automatically fills missing features
Prevents inference crashes
Returns transparent prediction metadata
5️⃣ Production-Style Deployment
Dockerized the service
Resolved runtime issues such as OpenMP (libgomp) dependency required by LightGBM
Ensured reproducible builds

 Build Log (Day-wise Development)
Day 1 – Problem Understanding & Baseline
Explored fraud dataset characteristics
Identified extreme class imbalance
Trained baseline model
Day 2 – Data Splitting & Evaluation Strategy
Train / validation split
Rejected accuracy as a metric
Adopted Precision–Recall based evaluation
Day 3 – Explainability Layer
Integrated SHAP for feature attribution
Designed human-readable explanations
Day 4 – Backend API
Built FastAPI backend
Defined request schemas
Added error handling and validation
Day 5 – Threshold Optimization
Performed PR analysis
Selected business-driven fraud threshold
Separated scoring from decision logic
Day 6 – Dockerization
Containerized the application
Debugged runtime issues inside Docker
Added system-level dependencies for LightGBM
Day 7 – Stability & Compatibility
Handled missing input features safely
Improved API robustness
Ensured model compatibility with frontend inputs
Day 8 – Frontend Demo
Built Streamlit UI
Connected frontend to backend API
Enabled end-to-end interaction for non-technical users

 Notes
Feature values are PCA-transformed and used for demonstration purposes.
The project focuses on system behavior and design, not real financial decision-making.
The architecture supports future extensions such as monitoring and GenAI-based explanation layers.

Future Improvements
Full feature auto-loading in frontend
Model monitoring and drift detection
GenAI explanation layer
Cloud deployment
